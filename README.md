# [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/)
Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving.

## Problems (285 in total @20181125)
Python 3.5+ is recommended until now. It's the future.

### [PV - Python Village](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=python-village)
If you are completely new to programming, try these initial problems to learn a few basics about the Python programming language. You'll get familiar with the operations needed to start solving bioinformatics challenges in the Stronghold.

Problems:
[INI1](http://rosalind.info/problems/ini1/) [`Installing Python`](https://github.com/lizc07/rosalind/blob/master/PV_INI1.py);
[INI2](http://rosalind.info/problems/ini2/) [`Variables and Some Arithmetic`](https://github.com/lizc07/rosalind/blob/master/PV_INI2.py);
[INI3](http://rosalind.info/problems/ini3/) [`Strings and Lists`](https://github.com/lizc07/rosalind/blob/master/PV_INI3.py);
[INI4](http://rosalind.info/problems/ini4/) [`Conditions and Loops`](https://github.com/lizc07/rosalind/blob/master/PV_INI4.py);
[INI5](http://rosalind.info/problems/ini5/) [`Working with Files`](https://github.com/lizc07/rosalind/blob/master/PV_INI5.py);
[INI6](http://rosalind.info/problems/ini6/) [`Dictionaries`](https://github.com/lizc07/rosalind/blob/master/PV_INI6.py);

### [BS - Bioinformatics Stronghold](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/)
Discover the algorithms underlying a variety of bioinformatics topics: computational mass spectrometry, alignment, dynamic programming, genome assembly, genome rearrangements, phylogeny, probability, string algorithms and others.
### [BA - Bioinformatics Armory](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=bioinformatics-armory)
Ready-to-use software tools abound for bioinformatics analysis. Whereas in the Stronghold you implement algorithms on your own, in the Armory you solve similar problems by using existing tools.
### [BT - Bioinformatics Textbook Track](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=bioinformatics-textbook-track)
A collection of exercises to accompany Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active-Learning Approach by Phillip Compeau & Pavel Pevzner. A full version of this text is hosted on stepic.org
### [AH - Algorithmic Heights](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=algorithmic-heights)
A collection of exercises in introductory algorithms to accompany "Algorithms", the popular textbook by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani.
