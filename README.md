## Problems (285 in total @20181125)
### [Python Village](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=python-village)
If you are completely new to programming, try these initial problems to learn a few basics about the Python programming language. You'll get familiar with the operations needed to start solving bioinformatics challenges in the Stronghold.

Solutions:
[INI1](http://rosalind.info/problems/ini1/) `Installing Python`;
[INI2](http://rosalind.info/problems/ini2/) `Variables and Some Arithmetic`;
[INI3](http://rosalind.info/problems/ini3/) `Strings and Lists`;
[INI4](http://rosalind.info/problems/ini4/) `Conditions and Loops`;
[INI5](http://rosalind.info/problems/ini5/) `Working with Files`;
[INI6](http://rosalind.info/problems/ini6/) `Dictionaries`;

### [Bioinformatics Stronghold](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/)
Discover the algorithms underlying a variety of bioinformatics topics: computational mass spectrometry, alignment, dynamic programming, genome assembly, genome rearrangements, phylogeny, probability, string algorithms and others.
### [Bioinformatics Armory](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=bioinformatics-armory)
Ready-to-use software tools abound for bioinformatics analysis. Whereas in the Stronghold you implement algorithms on your own, in the Armory you solve similar problems by using existing tools.
### [Bioinformatics Textbook Track](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=bioinformatics-textbook-track)
A collection of exercises to accompany Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active-Learning Approach by Phillip Compeau & Pavel Pevzner. A full version of this text is hosted on stepic.org
### [Algorithmic Heights](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=algorithmic-heights)
A collection of exercises in introductory algorithms to accompany "Algorithms", the popular textbook by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani.
